# Project Limitations
- **Geographic Scope:**
The analysis focuses on only three counties (Albany, Philadelphia, Delaware), limiting the generalizability to broader regions or underserved areas.

- **Provider Data Availability:**
The lack of county-level data from over the webpages (google search) required the use of zip codes as proxies, which may cause inaccuracies since zip codes often span multiple counties.

- **Fake Dataset Bias:**
The use of a fake dataset introduces potential bias in case the data does not accurately reflect real-world broadband conditions, affecting the reliability of insights.

- **Data Integration Challenges:**
Difficulty in matching broadband provider plans to the geographic data may lead to mismatches, affecting the accuracy of available service options in each county.

- **No Performance Metrics:**
The project lacks real broadband performance data (e.g., speed, latency), limiting the analysis to availability without assessing the quality of service.

- **Zip Code Aggregation:**
Aggregating zip codes to represent counties introduces inaccuracies, as zip codes donâ€™t align perfectly with county boundaries.

- **Stale Data:**
If the source data is outdated, the analysis may not reflect current provider availability, new entrants, or infrastructure updates.

- **Competition Analysis:**
The project focuses on availability but does not evaluate the competitiveness of markets, missing insights on consumer choice or market dominance.

- **Regulatory and Policy Exclusion:**
Changes in broadband regulations, funding programs, and subsidies are not considered, which could significantly affect the landscape.
